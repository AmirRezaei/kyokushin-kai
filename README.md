## Admin Roles & Technique Catalog

This app now supports admin-only technique management backed by the D1 database.

- Seed the first admin by setting `ADMIN_EMAIL` in your Worker environment.
- For local development, add `ADMIN_EMAIL` to `.dev.vars` (used by `wrangler dev`), not `.env`.
- Admin console route: `#/admin` after signing in with Google.
- Admins can grant/revoke admin role for existing users (users must sign in at least once).
- Techniques are stored in the `techniques` table; roles are stored in `user_roles`.
- Grades, katas, and curriculum assignments live in `grades`, `katas`, `grade_techniques`, and `grade_katas`.
- Use the Grade Management section in the admin console to assign techniques and katas to grades.
- Each technique or kata can belong to a single grade.

To seed the `techniques`, `grades`, `katas`, and curriculum tables from
`src/data/repo/catalog.json` (local D1):

```bash
bun run db:seed:techniques
wrangler d1 execute DB --local --file scripts/seed_techniques.sql
```

If you want the main technique views to use DB-backed techniques instead of the static
`src/data/repo/catalog.json`, wire `/api/v1/techniques` into the client data layer.
