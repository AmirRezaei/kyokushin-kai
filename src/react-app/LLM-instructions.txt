Project: Kyokushin
Description: A comprehensive web application for Kyokushin karate training, education, and management. Serves as a digital companion for karate practitioners, combining educational content with practical training tools, progress tracking, and equipment management.

Key Features:
- Educational Content: Motto explorer, terminology dictionary, technique library, word quest games
- Training Management: Session tracking, workout plans, exercise management, progress analytics
- Equipment & Exercise Library: Comprehensive catalog of training equipment and exercises organized by muscle groups
- Progress Tracking: Statistics, 10,000 days tracker, training history
- Practical Tools: Timer, breathing techniques, kihon training modules
- Data Management: Import/export functionality, local storage persistence

Application Structure:
- Single-page React application with client-side routing
- Material-UI based interface with dark/light theme support
- Modular component architecture with context providers for state management
- Local storage for data persistence (no backend required)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use

Data Management:
- All data stored locally using browser localStorage
- Utility functions in @/components/utils/localStorageUtils.ts for data operations
- Support for CSV import/export of training data
- Context providers manage different data domains (Equipment, Exercises, Training Sessions, etc.)

Tech Stack and Libraries:
- Core Frameworks: React, Vite
- UI/Styling: MUI v6, MUI X-Charts, MUI X Data Grid, MUI X Date and Time Pickers, MUI X Tree View, TailwindCSS
- TypeScript: Strict Mode Enabled
- Package Manager: Yarn

Additional Libraries:
- Drag-and-Drop: @dnd-kit/core, @dnd-kit/sortable
- Utilities: Lodash, UUID, date-fns, tone
- Data Handling: XLSX, react-papaparse
- Icons: MUI Icons, React Icons
- Routing: React Router DOM

Development Environment:
- OS: Windows
- Tools: PowerShell, VSCode

Coding Guidelines:
1. Purpose Summary: Provide a concise description of the file's role based on the "Purpose" section.
2. Code Quality: Ensure code is readable, maintainable, and optimized for performance.
3. State Management: Use immutable state updates and minimize state where possible.
4. Rendering Optimization: Utilize React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo to optimize rendering efficiency.
5. State Management Libraries: Avoid prop drilling by leveraging Context API or state management libraries.
6. Side Effects Management:
  - Ensure useEffect hooks are idempotent and handle multiple invocations gracefully, especially under React Strict Mode.
  - Clean up side effects in useEffect and manage dependencies carefully.
  - For persistent use the following utility functions in @/components/utils/localStorageUtils.ts.
    - const getLocalStorageItem = <T,>(key: string, defaultValue: T): T
    - const setLocalStorageItem = <T,>(key: string, value: T): void
    - const getLocalStorageItems = <T extends object>(key: string, defaultValue: T[]): T[]
    - const setLocalStorageItems = <T extends object>(key: string, value: T[]): void
    - const deleteLocalStorageItemById = <T extends { id: string }>(key: string, id: string): void
7. Modularization: Break down large components into smaller, reusable parts.
8. Semantic HTML & Styling: Use semantic HTML elements and modular styling approaches (e.g., CSS modules, TailwindCSS).
9. Error Handling:
   - Implement robust error handling.
   - Provide user-friendly feedback in case of errors.
10. Reactive State: Utilize useState or useRef for reactive state management; avoid using global variables.
11. Security: Identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, injection attacks).
12. Code Conciseness: Ensure all generated code is concise and excludes this header.
13. This app is a static site with client-side rendering (CSR) where all pages are pre-generated during the build and directly loaded into the browser (e.g., hosted on a static file server or CDN).
14. Avoid Duplicate Rendering during development builds due to React Strict Mode.
