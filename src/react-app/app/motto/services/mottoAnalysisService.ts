  // 1 – Courtesy
  Courtesy: {
    philosophy:
      'Courtesy (rei) is the visible expression of inner respect. It is more than politeness or ritual; it is the decision to recognise the dignity of every person you meet, whether they are stronger, weaker, friend, or rival. When courtesy is sincere, it softens the ego, prevents conflict from escalating, and turns even hard training into a shared, uplifting experience. In this sense, real fighting spirit is not loud or aggressive—it is quietly respectful, even in the middle of intense contact.',
    origin:
      'This motto reflects the traditional budo principle that all technique is built on etiquette. In classical Japanese martial arts, practitioners would bow before entering the dojo, before and after partner work, and even before handling weapons, to remind themselves that training is a privilege. Kyokushin preserved this spirit through the emphasis on “osu” and proper rei at the start and end of class, embedding respect into every stage of practice.',
    dojoApplication:
      'Enter the dojo with a clear bow at the door and a short pause to leave daily problems outside. When you line up, stand straight, focus your eyes, and treat the opening and closing ceremonies as training for the heart—not just a formality. Bow to your partner with genuine eye contact before and after every drill or round of kumite, showing that you value their safety and effort. Speak to instructors and sempai with attentive listening, and show equal kindness to beginners, helping them feel welcome and safe.',
    lifeApplication:
      'Carry the same level of consideration into your daily routine. Greet people properly, not just with a rushed “hi,” but with full attention, especially service staff, colleagues, and family members you may take for granted. In disagreements, keep your tone respectful even when you strongly disagree—this preserves trust and makes solutions easier to find. Small gestures, like letting someone pass, saying thank you sincerely, or apologising quickly when you are wrong, slowly transform your environment into a more peaceful “dojo” of everyday life.',
    meditation:
      '“In which interactions today did I fail to show true courtesy—perhaps by ignoring someone, interrupting, or responding coldly—and what concrete step can I take tomorrow to meet those people with more presence, warmth, and respect?”',
  },

  // 2 – Climbing the cliff
  Devotion: {
    philosophy:
      'The image of scaling a cliff describes a path that offers no comfortable flat sections—only continuous challenge. Progress on the Martial Way is not made by occasional heroic bursts, but by a steady willingness to keep moving when the body is tired and the mind wants to quit. This kind of perseverance does not ignore pain; it simply refuses to let pain define the limit of what is possible. Over time, each small upward step, repeated again and again, builds an inner strength that cannot easily be shaken by life’s difficulties.',
    origin:
      'This motto, rooted in Kyokushin’s harsh training culture, echoes the spirit of “osu no seishin”—the mindset of enduring, pushing through, and growing from hardship. Historically, Kyokushin dojos were known for full-contact sparring, demanding basics, and long kihon sessions, all designed to form a character that would not crumble under pressure. The “cliff” is both the physical training and the internal resistance we face within ourselves.',
    dojoApplication:
      'Show up to training on days when you feel tired, stressed, or unmotivated—these are often the most important sessions for your growth. During conditioning or long basics, instead of counting down the remaining repetitions in frustration, shift your focus to your breathing and posture and take pride in each completed technique. When you hit a plateau in your kicks, kata, or sparring, accept that this is part of the climb and keep refining the basics rather than chasing shortcuts or fancy moves.',
    lifeApplication:
      'Look at your long-term goals—health, study, work, relationships—as cliffs rather than short hills. Instead of constantly searching for quick fixes or magical motivation, commit to daily habits: a short study session, a walk, a meaningful conversation, a small debt payment. When setbacks happen, treat them as loose rocks on the cliff: uncomfortable, sometimes painful, but not a reason to stop climbing. By holding this mindset, you’ll see that true progress is measured in years of steady effort, not in sudden dramatic leaps.',
    meditation:
      '“Where in my life have I stopped climbing because the effort felt too steep, and what is one small, specific step upward I can take today—even if I don’t feel ready or motivated?”',
  },

  // 3 – Initiative without ego
  Initiative: {
    philosophy:
      'To seize the initiative means to move first, but not blindly. Real initiative in the Martial Way is the union of awareness and courage—seeing clearly what needs to be done and acting before fear, anger, or laziness take over. When ego controls initiative, actions become impulsive and destructive. When wisdom controls initiative, actions become precise, protective, and aligned with a larger good.',
    origin:
      'This motto is influenced by classical samurai strategy, where taking the lead in timing (sen) was critical, but doing so without self-control often led to disaster. Modern budo translated this idea into daily life: one must act firmly, but always with responsibility and awareness of consequence. Kyokushin’s emphasis on control in hard contact—staying composed under pressure—mirrors this principle.',
    dojoApplication:
      'In kumite, move with intention: choose when to enter, when to counter, and when to step back, instead of swinging wildly out of frustration or fear. Offer help without waiting for direct commands—assist with cleaning the dojo, guiding beginners, or preparing equipment as soon as you see the need. When conflicts arise between students, be the one who calms the situation, not the one who fuels it with gossip or sarcasm.',
    lifeApplication:
      'In everyday situations, do not wait passively for others to solve problems or make decisions that clearly belong to you. Speak up respectfully when something is unfair, unsafe, or unwise, but check your motives—are you seeking attention, or genuinely trying to help? At home, take initiative in small ways: repair something that is broken, plan a healthy meal, or start an honest conversation that everyone has been avoiding, always guided by clarity rather than irritation.',
    meditation:
      '“Think of a recent situation where I stepped in, spoke up, or took control—was my action guided more by ego or by genuine care and awareness, and how might I refine my initiative to serve something larger than myself?”',
  },

  // 4 – Money without attachment
  Detachment: {
    philosophy:
      'Money is a neutral tool that becomes dangerous only when it quietly takes the position of master in our lives. The Martial Way does not reject material needs but insists that they must never override integrity, compassion, or inner peace. When you see money as a servant, you can use it wisely; when you cling to it as part of your identity, you become easy to control and easy to corrupt.',
    origin:
      'This motto reflects the integration of traditional budo values with modern realities. Historically, many martial artists lived modestly and treated their art as a path rather than a business. As martial arts spread worldwide and became professionalised, this principle served as a reminder that fees, equipment, and commercial activities must not overshadow the spirit of training and personal development at the heart of Kyokushin.',
    dojoApplication:
      'Pay your dojo fees on time and treat them as a fair exchange to support your training environment, not as a burden to resent. Avoid measuring your worth by the brand of your gi, the price of your gear, or how many seminars you can afford; instead, measure it by your effort, attitude, and consistency. If you teach or assist, remember that your primary duty is to protect the quality and integrity of the training—not to maximise profit or prestige.',
    lifeApplication:
      'In daily life, manage your finances responsibly: budget, save, and invest in a way that supports your health and long-term stability. But refuse to trade your conscience, relationships, or health for a raise, a deal, or the illusion of status. Notice when fear of losing money controls your decisions, and ask whether your deeper values are being compromised. Let money serve your life purpose, not define it.',
    meditation:
      '“If my income and possessions were stripped away tomorrow, which qualities and relationships would still remain—and how can I invest more of my time and heart into those enduring sources of value right now?”',
  },

  // 5 – Posture as centre
  Posture: {
    philosophy:
      'Posture is the bridge between body and mind. When your stance collapses, your thinking often follows; when your spine is aligned and your centre is stable, your mind becomes clearer and more decisive. In martial arts, posture is not just about appearance; it is the physical structure that channels power, protects vital areas, and expresses confidence without aggression.',
    origin:
      'This principle arises directly from kihon and traditional stances such as zenkutsu dachi, kiba dachi, and sanchin dachi. In classical karate and other budo, the cultivation of “shisei” (correct posture) was seen as both a physical and spiritual practice—training the body to remain upright even under stress symbolised training the spirit to remain unbroken under pressure.',
    dojoApplication:
      'Throughout class, pay attention to how you stand between drills, not only during the techniques themselves. Do not slump, lean on walls, or stare at the floor when tired; instead, stand in a relaxed but ready posture, breathing deeply, eyes focused. In kata, feel how aligned posture allows techniques to flow with less effort and more stability. In kumite, keep your guard up and your stance active, so that you can move freely in any direction without losing balance.',
    lifeApplication:
      'Outside the dojo, use posture as a daily reset button for your state of mind. When you notice stress, fear, or sadness pulling your shoulders forward and your gaze downward, pause, lengthen your spine, open your chest slightly, and breathe slowly. In conversations, stand or sit upright to project calm confidence rather than hidden insecurity. Over time, you will find that changing your posture can change the way you experience challenges and how others respond to you.',
    meditation:
      '“How does my posture reflect my inner state throughout the day, and what happens in my thoughts and emotions when I consciously adjust my stance to be more grounded, open, and aligned?”',
  },

  // 6 – 1000 and 10 000 days
  Patience: {
    philosophy:
      'The numbers one thousand and ten thousand are symbolic reminders that the Martial Way is a long journey measured in years, not weeks. The early years of training build foundations: coordination, discipline, and basic understanding. The later years, layered on top of that foundation, reveal deeper subtleties of timing, distance, breathing, and strategy that cannot be rushed. This motto protects students from the illusion of instant mastery and invites them into a patient, lifelong relationship with their art.',
    origin:
      'Similar expressions appear in Zen, Chinese martial arts, and Japanese sword traditions, where “10 000 days” often represents the time required to transform basic skill into something approaching mastery. Kyokushin adopted this long-view mindset to counter the modern tendency to chase quick promotions, shortcuts, or superficial demonstrations of power. The motto is a reminder that time and repetition are irreplaceable teachers.',
    dojoApplication:
      'When you feel impatient about belts or progress, remember that each training session is one tile in a vast mosaic. Focus on showing up, giving honest effort, and improving one small detail each class—hip rotation, guard position, breathing, or focus. Celebrate milestones like grading, but see them as checkpoints on a much longer road, not final destinations. Encourage newer students to think in years, not months, so they too understand the value of patience.',
    lifeApplication:
      'Apply this principle in your personal and professional development. Whether you are learning a language, building a career, recovering your health, or raising a family, accept that deep results emerge slowly from consistent, aligned effort. Resist the urge to compare your “day 300” to someone else’s “day 3000.” Instead, commit to your own timeline and ask yourself, “What can I do today that my future self will thank me for in ten years?”',
    meditation:
      '“If I continue to train my body, mind, and character for the next 10 000 days, what kind of person do I want to have become, and what small decision can I make today that clearly belongs to that future version of me?”',
  },

  // 7 – Introspection and wisdom
  Wisdom: {
    philosophy:
      'Introspection is the practice of turning your attention inward with honesty and kindness. In the Martial Way, this means examining not only your techniques but also your attitudes, fears, and reactions. When you dare to see your own weakness clearly, it loses some of its power over you and becomes material for growth. Wisdom emerges when you repeatedly transform experiences—especially uncomfortable ones—into insight and better choices.',
    origin:
      'This motto resonates strongly with Zen traditions that influenced many Japanese martial arts, where meditation and self-reflection were considered essential partners to physical practice. In Kyokushin, the intensity of training acts like a mirror: under fatigue and pressure, your true habits, patience, and ego become visible. Introspection is the deliberate decision to look into that mirror instead of turning away.',
    dojoApplication:
      'After each class, mentally replay key moments: a combination that felt sharp, a mistake that kept repeating, a moment when you got frustrated or lost focus. Instead of judging yourself harshly, treat these observations as data. Ask your sensei or sempai for specific feedback and write down one or two “lessons of the day” in a training notebook. Over time, this habit turns each session into a step in conscious evolution, rather than just random sweat.',
    lifeApplication:
      'In daily life, use conflicts, failures, and embarrassments as opportunities for inner inquiry instead of only blaming circumstances or other people. Ask yourself: “What belief, habit, or fear inside me contributed to this situation?” Spend a few quiet minutes at the end of the day reviewing your actions and decisions—not to condemn yourself, but to better understand how you function. This gentle self-examination gradually increases your freedom to respond differently in the future.',
    meditation:
      '“What did my reactions today reveal about my current level of patience, humility, and courage, and what is one small inner adjustment I can make tomorrow that would express a wiser version of myself?”',
  },

  // 8 – Universal purpose, burning away selfishness
  Purification: {
    philosophy:
      'The Martial Way, at its deepest level, is not about defeating others but about refining oneself until selfishness loses its grip. Hard training functions like a furnace: it exposes impatience, vanity, and fear, and gives you a chance to transform them into discipline, humility, and compassion. As your practice matures, your perspective naturally widens from “How can I win?” to “How can I contribute?”',
    origin:
      'This motto reflects the evolution of martial arts from battlefield survival systems into paths of personal and spiritual development. As karate and Kyokushin spread globally, they became meeting points for people of different cultures, ages, and backgrounds. The idea of a “universal” Martial Way highlights that beyond techniques and traditions, there is a shared human journey towards greater awareness and responsibility.',
    dojoApplication:
      'When the training becomes exhausting, notice the part of you that wants to quit or complain, and instead choose to stay engaged and positive. As you gain experience, support others rather than using your skill to dominate or intimidate. Offer encouragement to those who struggle, and remember that every person on the tatami is fighting invisible battles outside the dojo as well. Let your effort and attitude raise the spirit of the whole group, not just your own performance.',
    lifeApplication:
      'See your work, family life, and social interactions as arenas where you can practice acting less from ego and more from principle. When making choices, ask not only “What do I want?” but also “What is fair, what is kind, and what will benefit the larger situation?” Use stress and adversity as chances to refine your character—to burn away habits of blame, self-pity, or greed, and replace them with courage, generosity, and clarity.',
    meditation:
      '“Which repeating desires or habits feel like heavy smoke around my heart, and how can disciplined effort—in training and in daily life—help to burn them away so that my actions reflect something larger than my own comfort?”',
  },

  // 9 – Point to circle
  Principle: {
    philosophy:
      'The point and circle symbolise focus and continuity. Every movement, every technique, begins from a single point of intention and ultimately returns to stillness. The straight line is decisive action, the circle is flowing adaptability; together they describe a way of moving and living that is both clear and flexible. Understanding this, a martial artist learns to strike sharply when needed, yet remain connected to a larger, harmonious pattern.',
    origin:
      'This imagery is influenced by Japanese calligraphy, sword work, and Zen symbolism, where a single brush stroke can express both direction and completeness. In karate, the interplay of linear techniques and circular blocks or redirections is fundamental. Kyokushin kata often embody this principle through transitions that begin from a strong centre (the “point”) and unfold into circular motions that absorb and redirect force.',
    dojoApplication:
      'In kihon and kata, pay attention to where each technique truly begins: in your intention, your breath, and your centre of gravity—not only in your limbs. Feel how your movements, though they may look linear, are connected by subtle spirals and arcs in your hips and shoulders. In kumite, move in angles and arcs, not just straight forward or straight back, maintaining a dynamic “circle” of options around your opponent rather than getting stuck on one rigid line of attack.',
    lifeApplication:
      'In your daily routine, identify the central “point” of your life—your core values or purpose—and let your actions radiate out from there instead of scattering randomly. Recognise the circular patterns in your habits, moods, and relationships: how certain behaviours keep looping back to similar results. By becoming conscious of these cycles, you gain the freedom to adjust them—interrupting destructive circles and strengthening those that support your growth.',
    meditation:
      '“What is the central point from which I want my decisions and actions to emerge, and how do the repeating circles of my behaviour—habits, routines, reactions—reflect or contradict that centre?”',
  },

  // 10 – Essence through experience
  Experience: {
    philosophy:
      'The true essence of the Martial Way cannot be captured fully in words, videos, or theories. It lives in the sweat running down your back, the rhythm of your breathing, the trembling of your legs during stance work, and the calm you discover after pushing past what you thought were your limits. Only through direct experience—especially when things are difficult, confusing, or scary—does the meaning of training reveal itself.',
    origin:
      'This motto reflects a central theme of all living traditions: that real understanding arises from embodied practice. In Kyokushin, this is especially clear in kumite and conditioning, where abstract ideas like “spirit” and “courage” must be proven under pressure. Historical figures in budo often warned students not to confuse intellectual knowledge with lived skill, emphasising “practice first, explanation second.”',
    dojoApplication:
      'Listen carefully to explanations, but do not stop there. Repeat techniques until your body begins to “understand” them without overthinking. Accept that bruises, fatigue, and temporary confusion are part of learning, not signs of failure. When you feel fear before sparring, step forward anyway in a controlled environment—that is where theory about “fighting spirit” becomes real, personal experience.',
    lifeApplication:
      'Outside the dojo, be willing to move from learning about life to truly living it. Reading about communication, health, or courage is useful, but it must be followed by real conversations, real changes in diet and sleep, and real decisions made under uncertainty. Let your values be tested in the situations that matter—work pressure, family conflict, moments of temptation—so that they shift from nice ideas into solid qualities you can trust.',
    meditation:
      '“Where in my life am I hiding in theory—consuming information, planning, imagining—without stepping into direct experience, and what is one concrete action I can take this week to bring that area into real practice?”',
  },

  // 11 – Grateful and confident heart
  Gratitude: {
    philosophy:
      'A truly strong heart is both confident and grateful. Confidence without gratitude tends to harden into arrogance and isolation, while gratitude without confidence can slide into passivity and self-doubt. When these two qualities balance each other, you stand firmly in your abilities while remaining open to learning, help, and connection. This combination creates a quiet, radiant strength that others can feel.',
    origin:
      'This motto resonates with the atmosphere of many Kyokushin dojos, where students say “osu” not only as a sign of toughness but also of appreciation—for their teachers, training partners, and the opportunity to improve themselves. Traditional budo often emphasised humility, but not in a way that shrinks the spirit; instead, it encouraged practitioners to recognise their progress while remembering that they stand on the efforts of many others.',
    dojoApplication:
      'Before training, take a moment to acknowledge the gift of having a body that can move, a space in which to train, and people willing to share the journey with you. Step onto the tatami with your head held high—not because you are better than others, but because you are fully committed to giving your best. When you succeed in a technique, accept the result calmly, thank your partner, and then look for the next opportunity to grow. When you struggle, be grateful for the lesson and for those who help you improve.',
    lifeApplication:
      'In your daily life, build the habit of mentally listing the things you are grateful for—health, relationships, opportunities, lessons learned from mistakes—especially when you feel discouraged. At the same time, honour your own efforts and strengths; do not hide them or pretend you are powerless. Use your confidence to take positive risks, to support others, and to stand up for what is right, while continually remembering how much you owe to the guidance, patience, and sacrifices of others.',
    meditation:
      '“What am I genuinely grateful for today, and how can I express that gratitude not only in words but through confident, constructive actions that reflect the best version of my character?”',
  },
};
